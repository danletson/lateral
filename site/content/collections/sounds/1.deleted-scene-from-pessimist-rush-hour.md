  <p>i’ve been obsessed with chris tucker’s early work recently
  </p>
  <p>the lines sound so much different in the present moment than they did to me in the past
  </p>
  <p>they now are more like prescient articulations of a horrifying future or a gonzo present
  </p>
  <p>each message opens up its own rift in time and space
  </p>
  <p>i get caught in these little eddies, the accumulation of which has become pessimist rush hour
  </p>
