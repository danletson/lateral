  <p>The notion that underlies this piece is levitation, both literally and metaphorically. When composing I imagined the possibility of the sonic elements existing in a parallel dimension, the aural aspect holding matter suspended as if it were an apparition in an interstitial space. In the presentation of the work, a literal manifestation or demonstration of low-end frequency levitation takes place using hand-crafted subwoofers with materials <i>hovering </i>in the windows of the boxes. The piece evolved out of studies accompanied by drawings and texts as investigations of <i>threshold states</i>. It is comprised of three movements which, forming a tapestry structure, allude to the triadic process of Hermetic sublimation.
