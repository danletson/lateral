companion_text: |
  <p>The work of Dove Bradshaw bridges the delicate line between object and environmental dynamics. Much of her material exploration is grounded in John Cage’s use of chance as compositional methodology, emblematic in works that employ elements such as live doves or ammonium chloride, the stochastic properties over which she has no control. Time is an active agent in Bradshaw’s oeuvre, lending her an exit route away from artistic bias or intention.
  </p>
  <p>In 1990 and 2014, Bradshaw curated two group shows at Sandra Gering Gallery in New York with works from the personal art collection of John Cage. The first of these shows had the title <i><a class="ext" href="http://dovebradshaw.com/Catalogues/A.%20Imitating%20Nature%201990.pdf" target="_blank">Imitating Nature in Her Manner of Operation</a></i> and the latter <i><a class="ext" href="http://dovebradshaw.com/Catalogues/Group%201990.2014%20Strategies%20of%20Non-Intention%20ANASTASI%20BRADSHAW%20CAGE%20MARIONI%20RAUSCHENBERG%20TOBEY.pdf" target="_blank">Strategies of Non-Intention</a></i>. The artists, consistent for both shows, were William Anastasi, Dove Bradshaw, John Cage, Tom Marioni, Robert Rauschenberg, and Mark Tobey.
  </p>
  <p>In this informal interview, Bradshaw discusses the underlying conceptual thread running through both shows and her own artistic practice.
