  <p>EL:  soo
  </p>
  <p>first<br>in terms of editing, mix of the track<br>any thoughts?
  </p>
  <p>Me:  I just listened through again<br>and was wondering about the order<br>of the question sets
  </p>
  <p>EL:  ok
  </p>
  <p>Me:  like what if we move the first question set to after the talking set?
  </p>
  <p>Me:  it’s hard to say though if that would make any difference<br>as it stands it’s not too bad<br>it’s just really austere in the beginning<br>and a little silly at the end
  </p>
  <p>EL:  hah
  </p>
  <p>Me:  though the pink noise helps<br>actually quite a bit<br>after the describing food section
  </p>
  <p>EL:  its a cleanser
  </p>
  <p>Me:  totally a palate cleanser
  </p>
  <p>EL:  I’ve been working with pink noise<br>natural comb filters<br>I’m open to changing the order<br>I think it might be better that way because<br>the call and response process<br>is sort of like q and a<br>not q and q<br>so if we rearrange it<br>it might make it clearer as just qs
  </p>
  <p>Me:  the first three sections<br>are pretty pat<br>as in they make a lot of sense as a series of responses
  </p>
  <p>Me:  what if we start with sine tone?<br>then COD<br>then food<br>then Mexico, your click track, pink noise and dog howl?
  </p>
  <p>EL:  ok<br>I can do that
  </p>
  <p>Me:  or at least give it a try
  </p>
  <p>EL:  the one mix thought I had<br>yeah<br>I’m into rearranging it<br>I think describing food sounds a bit bassy or loud or something<br>I might just bring it down a bit
  </p>
  <p>Me:  it’s a super shitty recording<br>done through a crap mic in front of a speaker
  </p>
  <p>EL:  I usually dont mess with the mix too much on LA cause I want it to be as it is
  </p>
  <p>Me:  either clean it up or make it messier
  </p>
  <p>EL:  ok I might just leave it then
  </p>
  <p>EL:  I think this is all about
  </p>
  <p>Me:  there’s some mic feedback that happens<br>that bassy part
  </p>
  <p>EL:  not changing things to make them more palatable
  </p>
  <p>Me:  no and my sort of thing is lo-fidelity<br>and shit recording
  </p>
  <p>EL:  good
  </p>
  <p>Me:  partially because I don’t have the right equipment
  </p>
  <p>EL:  ok I’ll leave it
  </p>
  <p>Me:  and partially because all these artifacts are becoming extinct<br>and that’s interesting to me<br>sonic extinction
  </p>
  <p>EL:  it’s all just diffusing into the ether
  </p>
  <p>Me:  so when I was listening again today<br>it sounded a bit less cynical<br>though I still wonder if it’s opening anything up<br>or is it just sort of lazy? I felt lazy on my part
  </p>
  <p>Me:  though I did spend some time thinking about how to pose a question in sound
  </p>
  <p>EL:  like our idea of “question” was too open ended?
  </p>
  <p>Me:  perhaps
  </p>
  <p>EL:  it’s a perspective, right?
  </p>
  <p>Me:  and we didn’t get a chance to really talk midstream about what was happening once we started passing sound back and forth
  </p>
  <p>EL:  true<br>well if you think about an actual interview<br>its a real time, intuitive activity
  </p>
  <p>Me:  yes
  </p>
  <p>EL:  so maybe you felt lazy<br>because you were thinking<br>“if this is a piece of work<br>this is lazy work”
  </p>
  <p>Me:  but if this is an interview<br>it’s probably more natural, less lazy
  </p>
  <p>EL:  going with whatever sound you think is appropriate
  </p>
  <p>Me:  I definitely think that back and forth interviews over the internet make it difficult to get the true face to face quality<br>because everyone spends so much time on their questions and answers<br>so part of me did want to be quick about things
  </p>
  <p>EL:  kind of like how everything is photoshopped<br>interviews are cleaned up<br>but I think the perspective point is important<br>because as long as you think of each section as a question
  </p>
  <p>Me:  is it worth it to share what kinds of questions we felt we were asking with the sounds?
  </p>
  <p>EL:  you will process the interview differently than if you experience it as a work<br>if you think the thinking behind them is interesting<br>I guess my thinking was kind of obtuse
  </p>
  <p>Me:  I mean I definitely took each track as a question
  </p>
  <p>EL:  more macro
  </p>
  <p>Me:  and started from there<br>sort of intuiting what was being asked
  </p>
  <p>EL:  I think it has interesting aesthetic implications though
  </p>
  <p>Me:  how so?
  </p>
  <p>EL:  well<br>like the aesthetics of an interview<br>but stripping that format of its normal traits<br>and filling it with material that is more commonly considered from an aesthetic perspective or attitude<br>telling a public this is an interview and not a work
  </p>
  <p>Me:  what are the aesthetics of an interview ?
  </p>
  <p>EL:  trying to struggle with how to approach the sounds<br>well I think all aesthetics is perspective<br>anything is art right?<br>its just how you approach it<br>but some things are more well defined than others<br>you go to a museum<br>or listen to a recording<br>it’s easier to say<br>this is art or this is music<br>when you listen to an interview<br>you probably focus more on the content<br>and think less about the particulars of the format
  </p>
  <p>Me:  my thought was what does it mean to pour different content into established forms<br>the form of the interview for instance<br>that A to B to C to D and so forth<br>or even the use of an interview inside an interview<br>is our interview more about the form of interview?
  </p>
  <p>EL:  yeah maybe its less about questions and answers<br>more about this kind of conversation format
  </p>
  <p>Me:  the abstraction of asking a question in sound is probably too broad<br>but the idea of making an interview in sound … hmmm..
  </p>
  <p>EL:  I think its pretty clear that<br>we were having a conversation
  </p>
  <p>Me:  yea.. I think so
  </p>
  <p>EL:  hmm
  </p>
  <p>Me:  is that less interesting<br>just a sonic conversation?<br>does that open anything up?
  </p>
  <p>EL:  we can just call it Interview
  </p>
  <p>Me:  I thought about the questions that these sounds may have raised
  </p>
  <p>EL:  yeah I think<br>it’s more natural to think of them as questions than answers<br>cause answers are closed<br>An Interview<br>in Sound<br>hmm
  </p>
  <p>Me:  that’s an important distinction right.. is this an interview, a discussion, a debate?
  </p>
  <p>EL:  its too serial to be any of those<br>think about the word interview<br>its a view of the inside
  </p>
  <p>Me:  it’s also really linear<br>which is more interview like
  </p>
  <p>EL:  we approached it that way<br>question is harder<br>I mean we can still think of the material as questions<br>but it might be less significant to explain that
  </p>
  <p>Me:  well supposing that it’s difficult to say who was asking the question and who was providing the answer<br>sonically it doesn’t seem so completely certain<br>in fact the most Answer Like sound seems to be the first one in a way<br>it’s a sound that seems like a statement to me
  </p>
  <p>EL:  hmm
  </p>
  <p>Me:  perhaps that’s on account of my relationship to the sample
  </p>
  <p>EL:  perhaps
  </p>
  <p>Me:  which I’ve used in so many different performances now<br>that is has a certain value that’s been assigned to it
  </p>
  <p>EL:  yeah
  </p>
  <p>Me:  the other sounds are all open for me<br>and mostly used here for the first time
  </p>
  <p>EL:  but it doesnt necessarily answer any of the other questions<br>in this context it works as a question
  </p>
  <p>Me:  I love when this guy talks about how he loves lyricism
  </p>
  <p>Me:  and cites Eminem as a favorite
  </p>
  <p>EL:  I thought it was perfect<br>do you notice he hardly takes a moment<br>he just reads off questions one after the other<br>he’s playing COD while he’s doing this btw
  </p>
  <p>Me:  he’s just scrolling through this screen<br>I thought about what it means to “play” something<br>when I listened to this
  </p>
  <p>EL:  “some really bad questions in here…”
  </p>
  <p>Me:  “no offense to those that sent them in” !
  </p>
  <p>EL:  I’m really happy
  </p>
  <p>Me:  shout out to MongolianGnome
  </p>
  <p>Me:  he’s very smooth
  </p>
  <p>EL:  whats your middle name<br>“joe”
  </p>
  <p>Me:  Bethel
  </p>
  <p>EL:  you? Bonnie Bethel
  </p>
  <p>Me:  Bonnie Bethel Jones
  </p>
  <p>EL:  solid
  </p>
  <p>Me:  do you carry a pocket knife?
  </p>
  <p>EL:  such a fine start
  </p>
  <p>Me:  I’m wondering about the impetus behind my response/question to this…<br>the describing food
  </p>
  <p>Me:  I think my response was snarky
  </p>
  <p>EL:  what is describing food from?
  </p>
  <p>Me:  english language lessons
  </p>
  <p>EL:  thats what i thought
  </p>
  <p>Me:  for Koreans<br>who probably dominate COD anyways
  </p>
  <p>EL:  I was thinking if I could go back and tweak what I did<br>my first question<br>after your sample<br>I would take out the last two sections<br>and just leave it silent<br>the first beating motif
  </p>
  <p>Me:  you could do that if you wanted
  </p>
  <p>Me:  the Mexico into that first section is musically awesome
  </p>
  <p>Me:  hard not to hear it that way
  </p>
  <p>EL:  we are changning it anyway
  </p>
  <p>EL:  and I like how it kicks off<br>we are photoshopping right now
  </p>
  <p>Me:  editing<br>actually
  </p>
  <p>EL:  I dont want to be doing this from an aesthetic place<br>but the choices i made
  </p>
  <p>EL:  originally were kinda aesthetic
  </p>
  <p>Me:  yea… I think my first question was aesthetic<br>but then again<br>I do have a strong attachment to that sample
  </p>
  <p>EL:  its good<br>its the starting point<br>we needed to start somewhere
  </p>
  <p>Me:  my other choices were made as quickly as possible
  </p>
  <p>EL:  what are we deciding on describing food<br>leave it be?
  </p>
  <p>Me:  I think I wanted to put it out there that the voice is an instrument<br>designed to convey meaning<br>but meaning isn’t really singular<br>so to a native speaker<br>the way this guy describes food is a little weird
  </p>
  <p>EL:  oily
  </p>
  <p>EL:  he thinks it’s all tasty
  </p>
  <p>Me:  that’s weird
  </p>
  <p>EL:  do you know this guy
  </p>
  <p>EL:  we should tour with him
  </p>
  <p>Me:  oily is for like skin and hair<br>and hot oil wrestling
  </p>
  <p>EL:  and oilies<br><a class="ext" href="http://www.oilies.co.uk/image/3%20packs_cleaned.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.oilies.co.uk/image/3%20packs_cleaned.jpg</a>
  </p>
  <p>Me:  I’m not sure I’ve ever had a conversation that felt completely open<br>at each turn<br>but maybe I’ve made music that had aspects of that
  </p>
  <p>Me:  entire areas unresolved
  </p>
  <p>EL:  i think thats a definition of a good musical experience
  </p>
  <p>Me:  what about the hounds do you think?<br>we had a duo
  </p>
  <p>EL:  I thought it was you at first
  </p>
  <p>EL:  thats a live duo?
  </p>
  <p>Me:  yes
  </p>
  <p>Me:  I guess I have been thinking more about nature and electronics
  </p>
  <p>Me:  perhaps this is on account of the cicadas
  </p>
  <p>Me:  they were up here in New York and I caught just the tail end of them<br>the 17 year guys
  </p>
  <p>EL:  aged and ripe<br>I’m thinking this piece<br>will be good
  </p>
  <p>Me:  not a piece..an interview
  </p>
  <p>Me:  maybe we should do a COD style<br>live tweeting
  </p>
  <p>Me:  we can set something up after you put out the edition<br>and open it to the public to live QA us<br>not that anyone would.. haha
  </p>
  <p>EL:  you never know
  </p>
  <p>EL:  what are we calling this?
  </p>
  <p>Me:  .. was trying to think about that<br>Could just be the usual.. Interview with Bonnie Jones & Ricky Laska
  </p>
  <p>Me:  I sort of love the idea<br>of you having a sort of regular thing<br>where you do some kind of interview<br>that tweaks the interview problem<br>of talking about music with musicians
  </p>
  <p>Me:  interviews and trying to tell someone about musical ideas in words<br>sometimes sucks
  </p>
  <p>EL:  yeah
