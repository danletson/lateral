about: |
  Lateral Addition aspires to enrich dialogues among contemporary practices in sound — improvisation, computer music, “sound art,” etc. — and other areas of current media and visual art. In order to nurture the growth of these connections, it serves to further elucidate the often esoteric methodologies and thoughts of artists working with sound through original audio material.
  
  Established in 2013, Lateral Addition releases sets of 4 audio and text contributions from an international roster of artists and writers on a bi-yearly schedule.
  
  [Remote Viewing](http://www.r-v.space/) is an affiliated project space in Philadelphia dedicated to the presentation of contemporary sound and multi-media work.
