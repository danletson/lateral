about: |
  Lateral Addition aspires to enrich the dialogues among contemporary practices in sound - improvisation, digital music, 'sound art,' etc. - and other areas of current media and visual arts. In order to nurture the growth of these connections, it serves to further elucidate the often esoteric methodologies and thoughts of artists working with sound through original audio material.
